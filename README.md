# Data-Augmentation-Project-in-Python
Increase the size of dataset of images fed into the program.

## Introduction

This project was given to me by my college teacher who at that time was pursuing her PhD. It part of her project work. I was given a small dataset of images, my work was to increase the size of this dataset. I used various image transformation methods to tweak the images and thereby increasing the size of the original dataset.
